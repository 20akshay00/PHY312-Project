## Charge Density Estimation using Pressure

This project was done in COMSOL 5.5, and involved exploring the piezo-electric effect on a few materials under different types of mechanical loads. The mph files can be found [here](./COMSOL_files), and the plots and GIFs of the simulation can be found [here](./images).

- A revealJS presentation was also given for this project, which is hosted on this website (it contains all the animations and images): [https://20akshay00.github.io/PHY312-Project/](https://20akshay00.github.io/PHY312-Project/)
